Mirror of the subversion repository of netgen-mesher
====================================================

This is an unofficial mirror of the netgen subversion repository and
is updated every 24 hours. The original repository can be found at

<pre>
svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/netgen-mesher/code
</pre>

The trunk of the repository can be found in the master branch. All old
branches 4.9,5.0,... are in respective git branches v4.9,v5.0,... .

Since the git repository is created from the original subversion
repository using git filter-branch, fast-forwarding of the individual
branches might not work all the time.

The shell script convert.sh and the authors file for converting the
subversion repository is located together with this README file in the
mirrorinfo branch.

Since this repository is only a mirror, pull requests will _not_ be
accepted/looked at.  For submitting bug reports/patches, see the 
[original website](http://sourceforge.net/projects/netgen-mesher)
or contact Joachim Sch√∂berl directly.
